<h1>Welcome to Jason Allen's Website!</h1>

<p>
  This is the website for Jason Allen. Please excuse the </br>
  appearance as I am still developing my HTML and CSS skills.

  On Monday, March 29, 1999, at 3:03 AM, I was born. I came into the world in </br>
  Boston, Massachuesetts. I lived the first 18 years of my life in Norwood, Massachuesetts. </br>
  I went to Callahan Elementary School, the Philip O. Coakely Middle School, and then </br>
  Norwood High School. I graduated 10th in my class of 240 students and began my studies </br>
  at Northeastern University, where I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering </br>
  and computer science.
