<h1>Welcome to the story of Alex Shapiro</h1>

<h3>The Beginning</h3>

<p>
    The name's Alex, although my friends call me AJ. I was born in a small town <br />
    in Tennessee. Nobody great ever came out of that town. It was <br />
    broken, corrupt. No one could stop the mayor from buying off the police <br />
    whenever he needed to. That was where I first became a spy. No one was coming <br />
    to rescue us, so we started our own resistance. My family was on the wrong side. <br />
    The mayor was close with my father and even closer with my mother. At first, <br />
    I was blinded by my family and trusted them too much. After my eyes were <br />
    opened by an event that can only be refered to as The HairCut, I renounced <br />
    my family name and joined a resistance group by the name of Salvator. <br />
    Because they wronged me during The HairCut, my loyality strayed. At the <br />
    end of the Seven Day Assault, I destroyed Salvator from the inside and <br />
    appointed my own ruler, one who was just and kind-hearted. After <br />
    that, I left Tennessee and started my career.
