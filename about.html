            <p id="early-life">
                For the first 18 years of my life, I lived in the suburbs of Boston. Then I decided to cut the "sub" part and started my studies at Northeastern University.
                I am pursuing a Computer Engineering degree. I love learning everything software from embedded design to high-level scripting.
                I'm always looking for a new language to learn and believe in learning something new everyday.
